I have encountered this problem before. When you use CUDA 8.0,the file cupti64_80.dll lies in C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\extras\CUPTI\libx64. I just fixed the problem by copying the dll into C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin, and the file cupti.lib in the same location into C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\lib\x64. And it works!

之后在cmd cd到生成的log文件目录后运行 tensorboard --logdir=地址
运行之后在chrome打开 localhost:6006
